 * to their consumers/put on the wire. As such, it's possible that several input signals might be
 * translated into a single output, or the reverse.
 * Note that it's possible (and even in some cases expected) that several input SignalInfos might
 * result into a single output SignalInfo.
 * For most uses, it's better if implementors just derive from ThreadedSignalProtocol.
